# Cribl Config Automation Script

This repository contains a Python automation script designed to streamline DevOps workflows for managing Cribl configuration files. It automates the process of:

1> Look up the config on prem folder 
> when any change is detected 
  > git add/commit/push to GitHub repo

2> any commit/push is triggered on GitHub repo
  > push that onto the CRIBL Cloud
